Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is free
Git is able to work with network.

Test git reset function.

Seems git rest could be used after add.
Green means it's already been added.
Red means it has not been added.


What's the staged means?  Untrack --> add (Stage) --> commit (branch)

Git focus on change, not the file, and the change should be follow by time. Is the ture?
